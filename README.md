# pokeword
Create a pokemon wordlist based on all known pokemon names.

Fetch pokemon data using the https://pokeapi.co API, which is actively updated. Extract the names from the name field and assign them to pokemon_names variable with timestamp appended for reference. Pokemon_wordlist(timestamp).txt will be created with each name in a newline, all hyphens removed, no spaces, and saved. Output will display name of file and number of names saved. View requirements.txt for dependencies.
