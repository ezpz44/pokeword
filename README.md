# pokeword
Create a pokemon wordlist based on all known pokemon names.

Fetch pokemon data using the https://pokeapi.co API, which is updated frequently. If 200 code is returned, extract the names from the name field and assign them to pokemon_names variable. Pokemon_worldist.txt will be created with each name in a newline and saved. Output will display name of file and number of names saved. View requirements.txt for dependencies.
